# Visual experience exerts an instructive role on the tuning properties and functional organization of cortical feedback inputs to primary visual cortex

## Overview
Code writen by Xinyun Zhang (xy.zhang@tum.de) and Nikos Malakasis (nikos.malakasis@tum.de).

This repository contains the computational models developed for the study. The two models simulate how visual experience shapes: 

1. feedforward receptive fields and their orientation selectivity, of neurons in the latero-medial visual cortex (LM), through inputs from the primary visual cortex (V1).
2. feedback receptive fields and their orientation selectivity, of neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1), through inputs from the latero-medial visual cortex (LM).
