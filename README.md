# Visual experience exerts an instructive role on cortical feedback inputs to primary visual cortex.
by Rodrigo F. Dias, Radhika Rajan, Xinyun Zhang, Margarida Baeta, Nikos Malakasis, Julijana Gjorgjieva and Leopoldo Petreanu

## Overview
Code writen by Xinyun Zhang (xy.zhang@tum.de) and Nikos Malakasis (nikos.malakasis@tum.de).

This repository contains the computational models developed for the study. The two models simulate how visual experience shapes: 

1. feedforward receptive fields and their orientation selectivity, of neurons in the latero-medial visual cortex (LM), through inputs from the primary visual cortex (V1).
2. feedback receptive fields and their orientation selectivity, of neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1), through inputs from the latero-medial visual cortex (LM).

## Repository structure 
Code developed using **Python 3.11.13**.

Required libraries: Numpy, Matplotlib, Scipy, tqdm, gwp, seaborn, pandas, starbars, open-cv.

To install, run: 
`pip install numpy matplotlib scipy tqdm gwp seaborn pandas starbars opencv-python`

Code files:

- simfeedfoward.py
  
This is the code for the simulation of the feedforward model, where orientation selective feedforward inputs from the primary visual cortex (V1) shape the receptive field of neurons in the latero-medial visual cortex (LM).

- generateffRF.py

This is the code for the generation of the receptive fields of LM neurons, based on the arrangement and orientation selectivity of the synapses
  
- processffmodelresults.py

This is the code for the analysis of the results generated by the feedforward model. Specifically, the RF tilt is calculated for multiple LM neurons over all 3 groups and statistically compared across the groups. 

- simfeedback.py

This is the code for the simulation of the feedback model, where orientation selective feedback inputs from the latero-medial visual cortex (LM) shape the feedback receptive field of neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1).

- processfbmodelresults.py

This is the code for the analysis of the results generated by the feedback model. Specifically, the ratio of boutons in the 135 degree bowtie is calculated for multiple V1 neurons over all 3 groups and statistically compared across the groups.
