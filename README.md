This repository contains the computational models developed for the study. The two models simulate how visual experience shapes: 

1. feedforward receptive fields and their orientation selectivity, of neurons in the latero-medial visual cortex (LM), through inputs from the primary visual cortex (V1).
2. feedback receptive fields and their orientation selectivity, of neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1), through inputs from the latero-medial visual cortex (LM).
